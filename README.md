# Java Learning Repo 

Hey there! Welcome to my Java learning journey. This repo is where I stash all my Java projects and college CS assignments. Dive in and check out my code!

## What's Inside? 📂

- **src/**: All the Java source code for my assignments and projects.
- **lib/**: Any libraries or dependencies I use.
- **bin/**: Compiled Java files.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mayankkanti/javaarc
    cd javaarc
    ```

2. **Open in your fave IDE** (I'm using VS Code and Eclipse, but you do you and configure it however you like).

## Contributing 🤝

This is my personal playground, but if you have cool ideas or spot any bugs, feel free to open an issue or PR!
